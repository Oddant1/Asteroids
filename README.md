# Asteroids
Asteroids in python3 turtle (Currently unfinished I will hopefully finish it some day)

**NOTE**

I have only ever run this on Linux Mint I don't know if there is anything here preventing it from working properly on any other platform

**Dependencies**

python3

python3 turtle library (pip3 install turtle)

python3 keyboard library (pip3 install keyboard)

**Instructions**

Run the asteroids.py file with python 3

Note it requires admin privileges to run (at least on linux) because it uses the keyboard library
